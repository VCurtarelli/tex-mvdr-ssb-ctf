In this study, we investigated the application of the Single-Sideband Transform in beamforming within a reverberant environment, utilizing the convolutive transfer function model for filter bank (i.e., the beamformer) estimation. We implemented a Minimum-Variance Distortionless-Response beamformer to enhance signals in a real-life-like scenario, elucidating the process to achieve a true-distortionless MVDR beamformer when employing the SSB transform. The results demonstrated that both the naive MVDR and the true-MVDR beamformers, designed using the SSBT, outperformed the traditional beamformer obtained via the Short-Time Fourier Transform. The naive MVDR exhibited some distortion on the desired signal, whereas the true-MVDR achieved a distortionless response, as expected.

Future research avenues may explore the integration of this transform into different beamformers, or undertake further comparisons against the established and reliable STFT methodology.
