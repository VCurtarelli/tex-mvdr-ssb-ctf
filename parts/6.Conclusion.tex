\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we investigated the application of the Single-Sideband Transform in beamforming within a reverberant environment, utilizing the convolutive transfer function model for filter bank (i.e., the beamformer) estimation. We implemented a Minimum-Variance Distortionless-Response beamformer to enhance signals in a real-life-like scenario, elucidating the process to achieve a true-distortionless MVDR beamformer when employing the SSB transform.

The true-MVDR SSBT beamformer matched the performance of the beamformer for the traditional STFT, in terms of SNR gain and distortionless response. The naive-MVDR SSBT beamformer's SNR gain performance varied with the number of samples per transform window, matching the others for fewer samples, but being outperformed for more. In both cases, it caused distortion in the desired signal in both cases.

Future research avenues may explore the integration of this transform into different beamformers, or undertake further comparisons of the proposed SSBT beamformer (following the considerations exposed in here) against the established and reliable STFT methodology.
