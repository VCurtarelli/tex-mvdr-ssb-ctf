\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have introduced a novel approach for designing a constant-beamwidth beamformer with null-direction constraints, utilizing uniform rectangular arrays and a generalized convolutional Kronecker product beamforming technique. By synthesizing beamformers for virtual arrays and applying our proposed technique to the full-array, we successfully achieved the desired features in terms of beamwidth and null placement. Moreover, by using virtual arrays and beamformers, we demonstrated the ability to enhance the signal quality in terms of white noise gain and directivity factor without compromising the beamwidth. Experimental results using simulated sensor arrays demonstrate that our method surpassed the performance obtained using only known techniques based on the Kronecker product for beamforming synthesis when assessing beamwidth, white noise gain, and directivity.
