\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we explored the use of the single-sideband transform for beamforming in a reverberant environment, using the CTF frequency model for calculating filter banks (that is, the beamformer). We employed an MVDR beamformer to enhance the signals obtained via a real-life-like situation, and detailed the process to obtain a true-distortionless MVDR beamformer when using the SSB transform. The results obtained showed that both the naive MVDR and the true MVDR beamformers obtained through the SSBT outperformed the one obtained using the traditional STFT, with the naive MVDR having some distortion on the desired signal, given its formulation, while the true-MVDR obtained a distortionless response, as expected.
