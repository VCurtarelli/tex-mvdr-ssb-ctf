\section{Pseudocode algorithms}
\label{app:algorithms}
%
These algorithms are written in a Python-like pseudolanguage. Brackets can denote both vector definition, and vector slicing/indexing. For example, $a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ denotes a $\sz{1}{5}$ vector, while $b = a[0:3]$ denotes a $\sz{1}{3}$ vector, such that $b = [1, 2, 3]$ (last-exclusive slicing, zero-indexing). Comments are added where necessary to clarify the steps.
