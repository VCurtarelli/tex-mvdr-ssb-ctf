\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} file is intended to serve as a ``sample article file''
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later. The most common elements are covered in the simplified and updated instructions in ``New\_IEEEtran\_how-to.pdf''. For less common elements you can refer back to the original ``IEEEtran\_HOWTO.pdf''. It is assumed that the reader has a basic working knowledge of \LaTeX. Those who are new to \LaTeX \ are encouraged to read Tobias Oetiker's ``The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX ,'' available at: \url{http://tug.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf} which provides an overview of working with \LaTeX.
