\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Filtering is one of the most important instruments available on the modern world, being necessary for things as communications \cite{chen_source_2002}, signal enhancement \cite{lobato_worst-case-optimization_2020,lu_biomedical_1994,nguyen_minimum_2017}, [...]. At its core, a filter is a mechanism through which one can mitigate the effects of some undesired sources that are contaminating a desired one. This can be implemented by utilizing either temporal information regarding the signals, but also spatial information (also called beamforming) about the signals and also the sources, sensors, and the environment in which these are located. Such filtering processes can be implemented in time-, frequency-, and time-frequency domains \cite{benesty_fundamentals_2017}, each of those having different advantages and use-cases in which they thrive. In particular, time-frequency techniques allow the exploitation of frequency-related information about the signals in question, while also dynamically adapting to signal and environmental changes over time, providing a good tradeoff between the advantages of using strictly time or frequency information. Two important goals in filtering are the distortionless-ness of the desired signal, and the minimization of the noise in the output signal (or the minimization of the output as a whole, assuming non-distortion of the desired portion). Both can be achieved by the Minimum-Power Distortionless-Response (MPDR) beamformer \cite{capon_high-resolution_1969,erdogan_improved_2016}. In order to extract the desired data from time-domain signals usually generated by sensors, the most widely used instruments for this time-frequency analysis are transforms, from which the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) \cite{kiymik_comparison_2005,pan_microphone_2021} stands out in the literature in terms of spread and commonness. However, alternative transforms can also be employed \cite{chen_wavelet-based_2018,yang_general_2014,almeida_fractional_1994}, each having its specific use instances and attributes, and offering unique perspective and information regarding the signal, possibly leading to different performances when fared for a common goal.

%Beamformers are an important tool for signal enhancement, being employed in a plethora of applications from hearing aids \cite{lobato_worst-case-optimization_2020} to source localization \cite{chen_source_2002} to imaging \cite{lu_biomedical_1994,nguyen_minimum_2017}. Among the possible ways to use such devices is to implement them the time-frequency domain \cite{benesty_fundamentals_2017}, which allows the exploitation of frequency-related information while also dynamically adapting to signal changes over time. The most widely used instruments for time-frequency analysis are transforms, from which the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) \cite{kiymik_comparison_2005,pan_microphone_2021} stands out in terms of spread and commonness. However, alternative transforms can also be employed implemented \cite{chen_wavelet-based_2018,yang_general_2014,almeida_fractional_1994}, each offering unique perspective and information regarding the signal, possibly leading to different outputs.

Among these alternatives, the Single-Sideband Transform (SSBT) \cite{crochiere_multirate_1983,oyzerman_speech_2012} is of great interest, given its real-valued frequency spectrum. This favors its implementation in simpler hardware, possibly leading to cheaper devices. It has been shown that the SSBT works particularly well with short analysis windows \cite{crochiere_multirate_1983}. Therefore, by using a convolutive transfer function (CTF) model \cite{talmon_relative_2009} to study the desired signal model, the SSBT can lend itself to be useful, if we think about the filtering process through the lenses of filter-banks \cite{kumatani_filter_2008,gopinath_tutorial_1993}. Thus, by applying this transform within this context it is possible to pull off superior performances than only with the STFT. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the transform, in order to properly utilize it to try and achieve better outputs. However, this transform lacks a deeper examination, and its properties have not been thoroughly studied and scrutinized, and its features limitations aren't currently known and available on the same level as others in the literature are, thus complicating its appropriate application and utilization, with present knowledge about it.

%Two of the most important goals in beamforming are the minimization of noise in the output signal, and the distortionless-ness of the desired signal, both being achieved by the Minimum-Variance Distortionless-Response (MVDR) beamformer \cite{capon_high-resolution_1969,erdogan_improved_2016}. As the MVDR beamformer can be used on the time-frequency domain without restrictions on the transform chosen, it is possible to explore and compare the performance of this filter, when designing it through different time-frequency transforms.

We start this paper by exploring the SSB transform, analyzing a continuous-frequency analogue to it in order to better explore its properties and drawing comparisons to those of the Fourier Transform (FT), which is the continuous-frequency parallel to the STFT. Equipped with a proper mathematical foundation to this new transform, we then approach the problem at hand, which is the design of an MPDR filter with the CTF model under the time-frequency domain on an echoic environment, doing so for both the STFT and SSBT transforms, and again drawing mathematical similarities between both of them. In order to fare them, we use a real-life-like scenario in which these filters are to be employed, and compare them through metrics that extract relevant information either regarding the beamforming design chosen, but also the environment and signals at hand. We show that a filter designed with the SSBT is mostly outperformed by an STFT filter, however in most cases by a sufficiently small margin, such that a small gain in performance can be sacrificed for a mathematically simpler transform, using its benefit of being real-valued.

%Motivated by the possible use the SSBT for filtering along the MPDR beamformer within the context of the CTF model, our paper 
%Motivated by this, our paper explores the SSB transform and its application on the subject of beamforming within the context of the CTF model. We propose an approach for the CTF that allows the separation of desired and undesired speech components for reverberant environments, and employ this approach for designing the MVDR beamformer. We also explore the traits and limitations of the SSBT, and how to properly adapt the MVDR beamformer to this new transform's constraints. We show that a beamformer designed using the SSBT can surpass the STFT one, while also conforming to the distortionless constraint.

We organized the paper as follows:
in \cref{sec:stft_and_ssbt} we introduce the proposed time-frequency transforms, how they're related and what are their relevant properties (which are expanded and fully explored in \cref{app:properties_rft});
\cref{sec:signal_model} the considered signal model is presented, and how to write the desired constraints in considering the time-frequency transforms at hand, taking into account their features and peculiarities.
In \cref{sec:results} we present and discuss the results, comparing the studied methods and beamformers obtained for a varied range of metrics, each exposing different information regarding their performances.
\cref{sec:conclusion} concludes this paper.
