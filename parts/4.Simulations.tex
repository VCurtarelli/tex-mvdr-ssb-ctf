\section{Comparisons and simulations}
\label{sec:results}

In the simulations\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/VCurtarelli/py-ssb-ctf-bf}.}, we employ a sampling frequency of $16\si{\kilo\hertz}$. Room impulse responses were generated using Habets' RIR generator \cite{habets_rir-generator}, and signals were selected from the SMARD database \cite{smard_database}. In all cases we will use $\Ld = \Ly$ and $\Delta = 0$; that is, we don't use any non-causal frames, and we consider as many frame samples as RIR samples.

The room's dimensions are $4\m \times 6\m \times 3\m$ (width $\times$ length $\times$ height), with a reverberation time of $0.3\si{\second}$. The device composed of the loudspeaker + sensors is centered at $(3\m,~4\m,~1\m)$, being comprised of $M=8$ sensors arranged in a circular array with radius of $8\si{\centi\meter}$, and all are omnidirectional of flat frequency response. The positions and signals used for the sources are in \cref{tab:sec4:information_position_sources}. The room's layout is in \cref{fig:room_layout}, where in green we have the desired source (assumed to be omnidirectional), and in red the device, with the $8$ sensors and the loudspeaker on the center.

All signals were resampled to the desired sampling frequency of $16\si{\kilo\hertz}$. For the transforms, Hamming windows were used, with a length of 32 samples/window and an overlap of $50\%$. The beamformers were calculated once for the whole signal, for faster processing and ease to compare the results. We will compare the two transforms exposed, the STFT and the SSBT, for a varying set of conditions on the signals and variables considered.

In the line plots, STFT results are presented in red and SSBT results in green lines. The output metrics were averaged over 200 frames and presented every 100 windows, for a smoother visualization.

\subsection{Basic comparison}
In this scenario, at the reference sensor (assumed to be the one at $(3\m,~1.92\m,~1\m)$), the SNR for the loudspeaker's and noise signals are respectively $-15\dB$ and $30\dB$. These will be referred as Signal-to-Echo and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SER and SNR) in that order. We will use $\Ly = 1$ and $\Ly = 15$ to illustrate two different cases in terms of samples used, one where we consider only the latest sample for each sensor, and another where we have sufficient samples for a (empirically) good enough performance.

\end{figure}

In these simulations, we are interested in three metrics results: maintenance/no-distortion of the desired signal; decrease in the loudspeaker's signal; and reduction/minimal enhancement of the white noise. In order, these will be measured by the desired signal reduction factor (DSRF), SER gain (gSER), and SNR gain (gSNR), the later being used for the white noise given that the only other undesired signal at the sensors is white uncorrelated noise. Their time-dependent broadband formulations are, respectively,
\begin{subgather}
	\dsrf[l] = \frac{\sum_{k}\abs{X_{1,k}[l]}^2}{\sum_{k}\abs{X_{f,k}[l]}^2} \\
	\gser[l] = \frac{\sum_{k}\abs{S_{1,k}[l]}^2}{\sum_{k}\abs{S_{f,k}[l]}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\dsrf[l]} \\
	\gsnr[l] = \frac{\sum_{k}\abs{V_{1,k}[l]}^2}{\sum_{k}\abs{V_{f,k}[l]}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\dsrf[l]}
\end{subgather}

From \cref{subfig:lineplot__DSRF_l__iSER_n15__err_0}, we see that in the case $\Ly = 1$ both filters led to some distortion on the desired signal, given that $\dsrf[l] \neq 0$, with the SSBT filter having marginally better distortion overall. When $\Ly = 15$, both beamformers led to no distortion whatsoever, indicating the correct formulation and modeling of the problem. This is due to the fact that when we consider only the current sample ($\Ly = 1$), previous samples of $X_{1,k}[l]$ interfere in the results, and increasing the number of samples ($\Ly = 15$) reduces this effect drastically.

From the gSER results in \cref{subfig:lineplot__gSER_l__iSER_n15__err_0} it is noticeable that the STFT filter outperformed the SSBT beamformer for both number of samples, marginally for $\Ly = 1$ (of about $1.5\dB$) and a larger margin for $\Ly = 15$ (around $5.5 \dB$). The reason is that, to achieve a distortionless behavior, the SSBT beamformer has to enforce twice as many constraints as the STFT, therefore having less ``freedom'' for the noise reduction portion of the enhancement. A similar result can be seen in terms of gain in SNR in \cref{subfig:lineplot__gSNR_l__iSER_n15__err_0}, where the STFT beamformer again outperformed the SSBT, by some small margin.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Comparison over different frame samples}

We also compare the two filters for a range of values of $\Ly$. From now on, the results will be presented averaging over all bins and frames as well, according to \cref{eqs:metrics_avg-bin-frame}.
\begin{subgather}{eqs:metrics_avg-bin-frame}
	\dsrf = \frac{\sum_{l,k}\abs{X_{1,k}[l]}^2}{\sum_{l,k}\abs{X_{f,k}[l]}^2} \\
	\gser = \frac{\sum_{l,k}\abs{S_{1,k}[l]}^2}{\sum_{l,k}\abs{S_{f,k}[l]}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\dsrf} \\
	\gsnr = \frac{\sum_{l,k}\abs{V_{1,k}[l]}^2}{\sum_{l,k}\abs{V_{f,k}[l]}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\dsrf}
\end{subgather}

In all plots of \cref{fig:lineplot__iSER_n15__Ly_var__err_0} we can see a behavior similar to that previously achieved. In the DSRF, we see that for both filters the distortion goes to zero as we increase $\Ly$, with the SSBT beamformer being barely better. We also see in \cref{subfig:lineplot__gSER__iSER_n15__Ly_var__err_0} that in terms of gSER the STFT beamformer consistently outperformed the SSBT one for all values of $\Ly$, in line with the result from the previous simulation. On the other hand, we see that for small values of $\Ly$ except $\Ly = 1$, the SSBT beamformer had a better performance in terms of white noise enhancement, although for an increased number of frames the STFT beamformer regains the lead.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Comparison over different input SERs}

We now examine the results with a varying input SERs, to assess the beamformer's performances for different loudspeaker signal levels. The results will be again presented for $\Ly = 1$ and $\Ly = 15$, representing two contrasting situations in terms of distortionless-ness and performance for the beamformers.

	\caption{Output metrics for the beamformers for varying input SERs.}
	\label{fig:lineplot__iSER_var__Ly_1__err_0}
\end{figure}

Each figure brings some new relevant information. From \cref{subfig:lineplot__DSRF__iSER_var__err_0}, we see that for $\Ly = 1$ the distortion on the desired signal increases as the input SER increases, and that the distortion is null for $\Ly = 15$, which is in line with the results previously obtained, as well as with the explanations found. Also, we see that over the studied range the SSBT filter has less distortion than the STFT one, except when $\iser = -30\dB$.

For the SER gain, we see that it decreases as the input SER increases, which is again on par with what would be expected. However, we see that for higher input SERs the performance gap between the two filters decreases, leading to practically identical results. We also see that with $\Ly = 1$ and higher input SERs, the SSBT filter has a better performance than the STFT one.

In terms of gain in SNR, for $\Ly = 1$ the STFT filter is mostly better (except for lower input SERs). For $\Ly = 15$, both have an overall similar result, also converging for higher input SERs.

%
%As exposed in \cref{sec:perturbation_analysis}, it is also of interest to compare how robust the derived beamformers are, when the information regarding the desired signal's RIR isn't accurate. For such, we model the matrix $\bvA[u]{k}$ as
%\begin{equation}
%	\bvA[u]{k} = \bvA[u]{k}^\star + \Delta\bvA[u]{k}
%\end{equation}
%where $\bvA[u]{k}^\star$ is the accurate steering matrix, and $\Delta\bvA[u]{k}$ is a perturbation on it, which we assume is a zero-mean uniform white noise, with an adjustable variance.
%
%Since in this scenario the desired signal can suffer some distortion (given that its steering matrix isn't appropriately estimated), we will use the gain in SER and gain in SNR metrics instead of ERLE and NSRF, to take this distortion into account. These are defined as
%\begin{subgather}
%	\gser = \frac{\erle}{\dsrf} \\
%	\gsnr = \frac{\nsrf}{\dsrf}
%\end{subgather}
%
%The DSRF will still be showed, to give a sense of proportion on how much the beamformer distorts the desired signal. In the results of \cref{fig:lineplot__v7_iSER_n15__Ly_1__err_var}, the x-axis represents the standard deviation of $\Delta\bvA[u]{k}$, as a percentage of the standard deviation of $\bvA[u]{k}^\star$.
%
%Each metric showed a different result: differently than before, the SF-SSBT beamformer led to the least distortion on the desired signal, out of all three beamformers, and the DF-SSBT led to the most distortion. Meanwhile, the gain in SER showed the STFT beamformer to be the (overall) more robust, and the one that led to the best results, with the DF-SSBT again being the worse one. A similar result can be seen for the gain in SNR, with the STFT beamformer being the best, but in this regard the SF-SSBT beamformer led to the worst results, although marginally.
