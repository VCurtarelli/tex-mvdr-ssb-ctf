\section{Frequency and Time-Frequency Transforms}
\label{sec:stft_and_ssbt}

When studying signals and systems, often frequency and time-frequency transforms are used in order to change the signal domain \cite{demuth_frequency_1977}, allowing the exploitation of different patterns and informations inherent to the signal. We from now on assume that all time-domain signals are real-valued.

For continuous time and frequency domains, the Fourier Transform (FT) is defined as
\begin{equations}{eq:sec2:def_fourier_transform}
	X_{\F}(f)
	& \equiv \FT{x(t)} \\
	& = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-\j 2\pi f t}\dd t
\end{equations}

We define the Real Fourier Transform (RFT) similarly, being cleverly constructed such that its frequency spectrum is real-valued without loss of information, as
\begin{equations}{eq:sec2:def_real_fourier_transform}
	X_{\R}(f)
	& \equiv \RFT{x(t)} \\
	& = \Sqrt{2} \real{\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-\j 2\pi f t + \j\frac{3\pi}{4}} \dd t} \\
	& = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \bts{-\cos\pts{2\pi f t} + \sin\pts{2\pi f t}} \dd t
\end{equations}
and the Inverse Real Fourier Transform (IRFT) as (see \cref{prop:RFT_IRFT_inverses} in \cref{app:properties_rft})
\begin{equations}
	x(t)
	& \equiv \IRFT{X_{\R}(f)} \\
	& = \Sqrt{2} \real{\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} X_{\R}(f) e^{\j 2\pi f t - \j\frac{3\pi}{4}} \dd f}
\end{equations}

We can also define the RFT in terms of the FT through a simple substitution of \cref{eq:sec2:def_fourier_transform} in \cref{eq:sec2:def_real_fourier_transform} (see \cref{prop:FT_RFT_equivalence} in \cref{app:properties_rft}), such that
\begin{equations}{eq:sec2:equivalence_ft_rft}
	X_{\R}(f)
	& = \Sqrt{2} \real{X_{\F}(f) e^{\j\frac{3\pi}{4}}} \\
	& = -\Re{X}_{\F}(f) - \Im{X}_{\F}(f)
\end{equations}

One can also write the RFT in terms of the FT as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sec2:equivalence_pair_ft_to_rft}
	X_{\R}(f) = \frac{1}{\Sqrt{2}} \pts{e^{\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\F}(f) + e^{-\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\F}(\-f) }
\end{equation}
from which we deduce that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sec2:equivalence_pair_rft_to_ft}
	X_{\F}(f) = \frac{1}{\Sqrt{2}} \pts{e^{-\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\R}(f) + e^{\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\R}(\-f) }
\end{equation}

\subsection{Convolution}

Given an impulse response $h(t)$ for a LIT system, the FT the convolution theorem states that
\begin{equation}
	h(t) \ast x(t) \hrel{\F} H_{\F}(f) X_{\F}(f)
\end{equation}
where $\hrel{\F}$ indicates a Fourier transform pair. It can be shown that this theorem isn't strictly valid for the RFT (see \cref{prop:conv_theorem_RFT} in \cref{app:properties_rft}). That is, if $H_{\R}(f)$ and $X_{\R}(f)$ are the RFT's of $h(t)$ and $x(t)$ respectively, then
\begin{equation}
	h(t) \ast x(t) \centernot{\hrel{\R}} H_{\R}(f) X_{\R}(f)
\end{equation}

However, it is possible to prove that there is an equivalent of the convolution theorem for the RFT (see \cref{prop:equivalent_conv_theorem_RFT} in \cref{app:properties_rft}), where
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sec2:convolution_equiv_rft}
	h(t) \ast x(t) \hrel{\R} X_{\R}(f) \Re{H}_{\F}(f) + X_{\R}(\-f) \Im{H}_{\F}(f)
\end{equation}
where, for a given frequency $f$, the convolution's output on the RFT domain depends on both it and its dual frequency $\-f$.

\subsection{Relative frequency responses}
\label{subsec:sec2:relative_transfer_functions}

Given two systems that share an input $x(t)$, each with an impulse response $h_1(t)$ and $h_2(t)$, on the FT domain $H_1(f)$ and $H_2(f)$, we can calculate their relative frequency responses (RFR's), respective to a common input. We denote these RFR's $A_1(f)$ and $A_2(f)$, respective for each system.

Let us denote $Y_1(f)$ as the first system's output, given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:output_sys1_ft}
	Y_1(f) = H_1(f) X(f)
\end{equation}
and similarly for $Y_2(f)$. With the FT, we write $X_1(f) = H_1(f) X(f)$, and thus $Y_1(f) = A_1(f) X_1(f)$ with $A_1(f) = 1$. We can obtain $A_2(f)$ as
\begin{equation}
	A_2(f) = \frac{H_2(f)}{H_1(f)}
\end{equation}
which trivially satisfies that $A_2(f) X_1(f) = H_2(f) X(f)$. These RFR's can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:calc_RFR_ft_expec}
	A_m(f) = \frac{\expec{X_m(f) X_1^*(f)}}{\expec{X_1(f) X_1^*(f)}}
\end{equation}
where $\expec{\cdot}$ is the expectation operator.

%\begin{changingfrom}
%	This isn't as straight-forward with the RFT, since after the convolution each frequency depends on its conjugate as well. However, by considering each system to have two inputs $X'(f) = X(f)$ and $X''(f) = X(\-f)$ and two transfer functions $H_m'(f)$ and $H_m''(f)$ (where $m$ represents the system's index), then our outputs can be described as
%	\begin{equation}
%		\label{eq:output_sys1_rft}
%		Y_1(f) = H_1'(f) X'(f) + H_1''(f) X''(f)
%	\end{equation}
%	and in the same way for $Y_2(f)$ under the RFT. From \cref{eq:sec2:convolution_equiv_rft}, we easily see that
%	\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:def_Hm'_Hm''_rft}
%		H_m'(f) = H_m'(\-f) = \Re{H}_{\sF;m}(f) \\
%		H_m''(f) = - H_m''(\-f) = \Im{H}_{\sF;m}(f)
%	\end{subgather}
%	We let
%	\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:def_X1'_and_X1''_rft}
%		X_1'(f) = H_1'(f)X'(f) \\X_1''(f) = H_1''(f) X''(f)
%	\end{subgather}
%	and therefore
%	\begin{equations}{eq:sec2:definition_X1_rft}
%		X_1(f)
%		& = H_1'(f) X'(f) + H_1''(f) X''(f) \\
%		& = X_1'(f) + X_1''(f)
%	\end{equations}
%	in which $X_1'(f)$ and $X_1''(f)$ are the inputs processed by the first system, and $X_1(f)$ is the observable input signal.
%	Through these, we get that
%	\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:rtf_systems_rft}
%		Y_1(f) = A_1'(f) X_1'(f) + A_1''(f) X_1''(f) \\
%		Y_2(f) = A_2'(f) X_1'(f) + A_2''(f) X_1''(f)
%	\end{subgather}
%	where
%	\begin{equation}
%		\label{eq:sec2:rtf_form_rft}
%		A_m^{n}(f) = \frac{H_m^{n}(f)}{H_1^{n}(f)}
%	\end{equation}
%	are the RFR's for the $n$-th input, between the $m$-th system and the reference (assumed to be $m=1$). Trivially, $A_1'(f) = A_1''(f) = 1$. Through the properties of the RFT exposed in \cref{app:properties_rft}, we can build the following system of equations:
%	\begin{subalign}{eqs:sec2:system_equations}
%		\expec{X_{1}(f) X_{1}(f)}   & = \pts{  {\Re{H_{1\F}}}^2(f)             + {\Im{H_{1\F}}}^2(f)         } \sigma_{X}^2(f) \label{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq1} \\
%		\expec{X_{1}(f) X_{2}(f)}   & = \pts{   \Re{H_{1\F}}(f) H_{2\F}^\re(f) +  \Im{H_{1\F}} H_{2\F}^\im(f)} \sigma_{X}^2(f) \label{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq2} \\
%		\expec{X_{1}(f) X_{2}(\-f)} & = \pts{- \Re{H_{1\F}}(f) H_{2\F}^\im(f) +  \Im{H_{1\F}} H_{2\F}^\re(f)} \sigma_{X}^2(f) \label{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq3}
%	\end{subalign}
%	where $H_{m\F}(f) = \Re{H_{m\F}}(f) + \j\Im{H_{m\F}}(f)$ is the FT of $h_m(t)$, and $\sigma_X^2(f) = \expec{X_{\F}(f)^2} = \expec{X_{\R}(f)^2}$.
%	
%	Note that, we have 3 equations and 5 variables. We define the following variables
%	\begin{equations}
%		\ar & 	= \Re{H_{1\F}}(f) \sigma_X(f) \\
%		\ai & 	= \Im{H_{1\F}}(f) \sigma_X(f) \\
%		\gr & 	= \frac{\Re{H_{2\F}}(f) \sigma_X(f)}{\ar} \\
%		\gi & 	= \frac{\Im{H_{2\F}}(f) \sigma_X(f)}{\ai}
%	\end{equations}
%	\begin{equations}
%		\E{11} 	& 	= \expec{X_{1}(f) X_{1}(f)} \\
%		\E{12}	& 	= \expec{X_{1}(f) X_{2}(f)} \\
%		\E*{12} &   = \expec{X_{1}(f) X_{2}(\-f)}
%	\end{equations}
%	where we will be omitting the $(f)$ index for clarity in these newly defined variables, however they are frequency-dependent. With this, \cref{eqs:sec2:system_equations} becomes	
%	\begin{subalign}{eqs:sec2:system_equations_gamma}
%		\ar^2 + \ai^2 & = \E{11} \label{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:subeq1} \\
%		\ar^2 \gr + \ai^2 \gi & = \E{12} \label{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:subeq2} \\
%		\ar\ai\pts{\gr - \gi} & = \E*{12} \label{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:subeq3}
%	\end{subalign}
%	
%	In this new scenario our objective is to calculate $\gr$ and $\gi$, since
%	\begin{subgather}
%		A_{2,\R}'(f) = \gr \\
%		A_{2,\R}''(f) = \gi
%	\end{subgather}
%	
%	Firstly, from \cref{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:subeq2,eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:subeq2} we can find $\gr$ and $\gi$ in terms of the expectations, $\ar$ and $\ai$. Solving it gives us
%	\begin{subalign}{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:sol_gr_gi}
%		\gr & = \frac{\E{12}}{\E{11}} + \frac{\frac{\ai}{\ar} \E*{12}}{\E{11}} \\
%		\gi & = \frac{\E{12}}{\E{11}} - \frac{\frac{\ar}{\ai} \E*{12}}{\E{11}}
%	\end{subalign}
%	
%	It is easy to verify that
%	\begin{subgather}
%		\expec{X_2(f) X_1(\-f)} = -\E*{12} \\
%		\begin{split}
%			\expec{X_2(f)^2}
%			& = \frac{\E*{12}^2 + \E{12}^2}{\E{11}} \\
%			& = \ar^2 \gr^2 + \ai^2 \gi^2
%		\end{split}
%	\end{subgather}
%	not being useful to solve this problem since they're dependent equations. Other possibilities include trying to use the FT's RFR, however it is also easy to check that 
%	\begin{subgather}
%		\abs{A_{m;\F}(f)}^2 = \frac{\E{22}}{\E{11}} \\
%		\angle{A_{m;\F}(f)} = \atan{\frac{\E*{12}}{\E{12}}}
%	\end{subgather}
%	thus again not being independent relationships between the variables at hand. This is an under-determined system with $3$ equations and $4$ variables, which has infinite solutions. Given any choice of $\ar$ such that $\abs{\ar} \leq \E{11}$, we can find $\ai$ through \cref{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:subeq1}, and $\gr$ and $\gi$ (which are equivalent to $A_{2,\R}'$ and $A_{2,\R}''$) via \cref{eq:sec2:system_equations_gamma:sol_gr_gi}.
%\end{changingfrom}
This isn't as straight-forward with the RFT, since after the convolution each frequency depends on its conjugate as well. We consider each system to have two inputs $X'(f) = X(f)$ and $X''(f)= X(\-f)$ and two transfer functions $H_m'(f)$ and $H_m''(f)$ (where $m$ represents the system's index). Then, our outputs can be described as
\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_H}
	X_1(f) = H_1'(f) X'(f) + H_1''(f) X''(f) \label{eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_H:subeq1}\\
	X_2(f) = H_2'(f) X'(f) + H_2''(f) X''(f) \label{eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_H:subeq2}
\end{subgather}

From \cref{eq:sec2:convolution_equiv_rft}, we easily see that
\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:def_Hm'_Hm''_rft}
	H_m'(f) = H_m'(\-f) = \Re{H}_{\sF;m}(f) \\
	H_m''(f) = - H_m''(\-f) = \Im{H}_{\sF;m}(f)
\end{subgather}

We now let $X_1'(f) = X_1(f)$ and $X_1''(f) = X_1(\-f)$, as our new system inputs. We write
\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_G}
	X_1(f) = A_1'(f) X_1'(f) + A_1''(f) X_1''(f) \\
	X_2(f) = A_2'(f) X_1'(f) + A_2''(f) X_1''(f)
\end{subgather}
where $A_m'(f)$ and $A_m''(f)$ are the relative frequency responses between the new inputs $X_1'(f)$ and $X_1''(f)$ and the output $X_m(f)$. Trivially, we easily see that $A_1'(f) = 1$ and $A_1''(f) = 0$.

Using \cref{eqs:sec2:def_Hm'_Hm''_rft,eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_H:subeq1}, we have that
\begin{equation}
	X_2(f) = \bts{A_2'(f) H_1'(f) - A_2''(f) H_1''(f)} X'(f) + \bts{A_2'(f) H_1''(f) + A_2''(f) H_1'(f)} X''(f)
\end{equation}
and, by comparing with $X_2(f)$ from \cref{eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_H:subeq2}, we have a system of equations (omitting the frequency index for simplicity)
\begin{subgather}
	A_2' H_1' - A_2'' H_1'' = H_2' \\
	A_2' H_1'' + A_2'' H_1' = H_2''
\end{subgather}
whose solution is
\begin{subgather}
	A_2' = \frac{H_1' H_2' + H_1'' H_2''}{{H_1'}^2 + {H_1''}^2} \\
	A_2'' = \frac{H_1' H_2'' - H_1'' H_2'}{{H_1'}^2 + {H_1''}^2}
\end{subgather}

Through the properties of the RFT exposed in \cref{app:properties_rft}, we have that
\begin{subalign}{eqs:sec2:system_equations}
	\expec{X_{1}(f) X_{1}(f)}   & = \pts{ {H_1'}^2(f)      + {H_1''}^2(f)     } \sigma_{X}^2(f) \label{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq1} \\
	\expec{X_{1}(f) X_{2}(f)}   & = \pts{ H_1'(f) H_2'(f)  +  H_1'(f) H_2'(f) } \sigma_{X}^2(f) \label{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq2} \\
	\expec{X_{1}(\-f) X_{2}(f)} & = \pts{ H_1'(f) H_2''(f) -  H_1''(f) H_2'(f)} \sigma_{X}^2(f) \label{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq3}
\end{subalign}
where $\sigma_X^2(f) = \expec{X_{\F}(f)^2} = \expec{X_{\R}(f)^2}$. With this, it is trivial to see that
\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec}
	A_2'(f) = \frac{\expec{X_1(f) X_2(f)}}{\expec{X_1^2(f)}} \label{eq:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec:subeq1} \\
	A_2''(f) = \frac{\expec{X_1(\-f) X_2(f)}}{\expec{X_1^2(f)}} \label{eq:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec:subeq2}
\end{subgather}
These formulations are the same as those in \cref{eq:sec2:calc_RFR_ft_expec}, but without the complex-conjugate operation (given that here all signals are real-valued), and for \cref{eq:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec:subeq2} we calculate the correlation with the cross-frequency signal $X_{1}(\-f)$. \cref{prop:RFT_same-variance_FT} was also used, such that $\expec{X_1(f)^2} = \expec{X_1(\-f)^2}$.

Generalizing to a situation with $M$ sensors, one can follow the same steps and achieve that, for each $m$-th sensor, we have
\begin{subgather}{eqs:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec_generic}
	A_m'(f) = \frac{\expec{X_1(f) X_m(f)}}{\expec{X_1^2(f)}} \label{eqs:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec_generic:subeq1} \\
	A_m''(f) = \frac{\expec{X_1(\-f) X_m(f)}}{\expec{X_1^2(f)}} \label{eqs:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec_generic:subeq2} 
\end{subgather}

This also works for $m = 1$. Trivially, \cref{eqs:sec2:calc_RFR_rft_expec_generic:subeq1} reduces to $A_1'(f) = 1$, and using that $X_1(f)$ and $X_1(\-f)$ are uncorrelated (see \cref{prop:conjugate-freqs_independent_RFT}), then $A_1''(f) = 0$, as expected.

Note that the FT formulation from \cref{eq:output_sys1_ft} can be seen as a particular case of the RFT (comparing \cref{eq:output_sys1_ft} with \cref{eqs:sec2:system_eqs_X1f_X2f_H}), where $A_{m}'(f) = A_{m;\F}(f)$, and $A_{m}''(f) = 0$. Therefore, from now on we will use the SSBT formulation from \cref{eq:sec2:system_ctf_ssbt_output} for both the SSBT and the STFT, as it is a less restricting model, and when particularizing the equations for the STFT we will use the considerations stated before.

\subsection{Discrete time-frequency transforms}

Given a time-domain signal $x[n]$, its Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) \cite{kiymik_comparison_2005,pan_microphone_2021} is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:def_stft_xn}
	X_{\sF}[l,k] = \sum_{n=0}^{K-1} w[n] x[n + l\cdot O] e^{-\j 2\pi k \frac{(n + l\cdot O)}{K}}
\end{equation}
where $w[n]$ is an analysis window of length $K$; and $O$ is the overlap between windows of the transform, usually $O = \floor{\nicefrac{K}{2}}$. The STFT can be seen as a discretization of the FT, while also applying it over different ``snippets'' of time.

%Even though the STFT is the most traditionally used time-frequency transform, it isn't the only one available. Thus, exploring different possibilities for such an operation can be useful and lead to interesting results.

The Single-Sideband Transform (SSBT) \cite{crochiere_multirate_1983} is similarly defined, being the RFT's windowed discrete-time adaptation. The SSB transform of $x[n]$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:def_ssbt_xn}
	X_{\sS}[l,k] = \Sqrt{2} \real{\sum_{n=0}^{K-1} w[n] x[n + l\cdot O] e^{-\j 2\pi k \frac{(n + l\cdot O)}{K} + \j\frac{3\pi}{4} } }
\end{equation}

One advantage of using the STFT is that we only need to work with $\floor{\nicefrac{(K+1)}{2}}+1$ frequency bins, given its complex-conjugate behavior. Meanwhile, the SSBT requires all $K$ bins to correctly capture all information of $x[n]$, however it is real-valued.

Assuming that all $K$ bins of the STFT are available, like with \cref{eq:sec2:equivalence_ft_rft,eq:sec2:equivalence_pair_ft_to_rft,eq:sec2:equivalence_pair_rft_to_ft} we have\footnote{For the abuse of notation, we let $X_{\sS}[l,K] \equiv X_{\sS}[l,0]$, and equally for $X_{\sF}[l,K]$.}
\begin{equations}
	\label{eq:sec2:equivalence_stft_ssbt}
	X_{\sS}[l,k]
	& = \Sqrt{2} \real{X_{\sF}[l,k] e^{\j\frac{3\pi}{4}}} \\
	& = - \real{X_{\sF}[l,k]} - \imag{X_{\sF}[l,k]}
\end{equations}
\begin{equation}
	X_{\sS}[l,k] = \frac{1}{\Sqrt{2}} \pts{ e^{\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\sF}[l,k] + e^{-\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\sF}[l,K-k] }
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:equivalence_ssbt_stft}
	X_{\sF}[l,k] = \frac{1}{\Sqrt{2}} \pts{ e^{-\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\sS}[l,k] + e^{\j\frac{3\pi}{4}} X_{\sS}[l,K-k] }
\end{equation}

As was the case for the RFT, the SSBT also doesn't hold the convolution theorem the same way as the STFT does. However, similarly to what was shown in \cref{eq:sec2:convolution_equiv_rft} (and in \cref{prop:equivalent_conv_theorem_RFT}), we can write the convolution on the SSBT domain as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:convolution_on_ssbt_mtf}
	h[n] \ast x[n] \hrel{\sS} X_{\sS}[l,k] H_{\sS}'[k] + X_{\sS}[l,K-k] H_{\sS}''[k]
\end{equation}
or, with the convolutive transfer function (CTF) model \cite{talmon_relative_2009},
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:convolution_on_ssbt_ctf}
	h[n] \ast x[n] \hrel{\sS} X_{\sS}[l,k] \ast H_{\sS}'[l,k] + X_{\sS}[l,K-k] \ast H_{\sS}''[l,k]
\end{equation}
in which this convolution is done over the frames $l$, with $H_{\sS}'[l,k] = \Re{H}_{\sF}[l,k]$ and $H_{\sS}''[l,k] = \Im{H}_{\sF}[l,k]$. Note that this is an approximation, as for the real convolution theorem one would need to consider cross-band interference \cite{??}, however this effect wasn't considered here, neither for the STFT nor the SSBT. Also note that the presence of the conjugate frequency is a byproduct different to the cross-band interference, which happens due to aliasing.

\subsection{RFR estimation for time-frequency transforms}
\label{subsec:sec2:rfr_estimation_time-freq_transforms}
Under the same assumptions as in \cref{subsec:sec2:relative_transfer_functions}, we can write the output of our systems with the CTF model in the SSBT domain as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sec2:system_ctf_ssbt_output}
	X_{m;\sS}[l,k] = X_{1;\sS}[l,k] \ast A_{m;\sS}'[l,k] + X_{1;\sS}[l,K-k] \ast A_{m;\sS}''[l,k]
\end{equation}
where $A_{m;\sS}'[l,k]$ and $A_{m;\sS}''[l,k]$ are calculated in a similar way to $A_m'(f)$ and $A_m''(f)$ from \cref{subsec:sec2:relative_transfer_functions}. While it was shown in \cref{subsec:sec2:relative_transfer_functions} that, for the FT and RFT, the relative transfer functions could be estimated from the frequency signals, this also needs to be shown for the time-frequency transforms. In particular, under the STFT, given $X_{m;\sF}[l,k]$ and $X_{1;\sF}[l,k]$, we have that
\begin{equations}
	\expec{X_{m;\sF}[l+\lambda,k] X_{1;\sF}^*[l,k]}
	& = \expec{\sum_{\tau}A_{m;\sF}[\tau,k] X_{1;\sF}[l+\lambda-\tau,k] X_{1;\sF}^*[l,k]} \\
	& = \sum_{\tau} A_{m;\sF}[\tau,k] \expec{X_{1;\sF}[l+\lambda-\tau,k] X_{1;\sF}^*[l,k]} \\
	& = \sum_{\tau} A_{m;\sF}[\tau,k] \sigma_{X,\lambda-\tau}^2[k]
\end{equations}
which is only equal to $A_{m;\sF}[\lambda] \sigma_{X}^2$ (as in \cref{eq:sec2:system_equations:subeq2}) if $\sigma_{X,\gamma-\tau} = 0$ for $\lambda \neq \tau$; that is, different samples of our desired signal are uncorrelated. This is untrue for time-frequency transforms, given their overlap and windowing processes, but also since our desired signal is the signal observed on the reference sensor $X_{1;\sF}[l,k] = H_{1;\sF}[l,k] \ast X_{\sF}[l,k]$.

Applying this same process for the SSBT, we have that
\begin{equation}
	\expec{X_{m;\sS}[l+\lambda,k] X_{1;\sS}[l,k]} = \sum_{\tau} A_{m;\sS}'[\tau,k] \sigma_{X',\lambda-\tau}^2[k] + \sum_{\gamma} A_{m;\sS}''[\gamma,k] \sigma_{X'X'',\lambda-\gamma}^2[k]
\end{equation}

Through a similar development as done before, but now on $\expec{X_{1;\sS}[l+\lambda-\gamma,k] X_{1;\sS}[l,k]}$, we get that
\begin{equations}
	\sigma_{X'X'',\lambda-\gamma}^2[k]
	& = \expec{X'_{1;\sS}[l+\gamma - \lambda,k] X''_{1;\sS}[l,k]} \\
	& = \sum_{\mu \geq 0} (H'_{1,\mu} - H'_{1,-\mu})(H''_{1,\mu + (\lambda - \gamma)} - H''_{1,\mu - (\lambda - \gamma)}) \sigma_{X}^2[k]
\end{equations}
with $\sigma_{X}^2[k]$ being the desired signal's variance at source. Note that for $\mu = 0$ the sum's is 0, which reflects the independence between $X_1'[l,k]$ and $X_1''[l,k]$, but this isn't strictly the case for $\mu \neq 0$. Thus, even though we have shown that conjugate frequencies are independent, this isn't true for conjugate frequencies on different frames. Therefore, applying this process for the SSBT adds errors not only due to correlation of different frames in the desired signal, but for conjugate frequencies as well. This decreases its robustness of the beamformer through this transform, making it more prone to output distortion due to mismatch in the estimation of the relative frequency response.
