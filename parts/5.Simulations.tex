\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:results}

In the simulations\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/VCurtarelli/py-ssb-ctf-bf}.}, we employ a sampling frequency of $16\si{\kilo\hertz}$. The sensor array consists of a uniform linear array with 10 sensors spaced at $2\si{\cm}$. Room impulse responses were generated using Habets' RIR generator \cite{habets_rir-generator}, and signals were selected from the SMARD \cite{smard_database} and LINSE \cite{linse_database} databases.

The room's dimensions are $4\m \times 6\m \times 3\m$ (width $\times$ length $\times$ height), with a reverberation time of $0.11\si{\second}$. The desired source is located at $(2\m,~1\m,~1\m)$, it being a male voice (SMARD, \texttt{50\_male\_speech\_english\_ch8\_OmniPower4296.flac}).
%
The interfering source, simulating an open door, is located simultaneously at $(0.5\m,~5\m,~[0.3:0.3:2.7]\m)$, with a babble sound signal (LINSE database, \texttt{babble.mat}). The noise signal is white Gaussian noise (SMARD database, \texttt{wgn\_48kHz\_ch8\_OmniPower4296.flac}). All signals were resampled to the desired frequency.

The sensor array is positioned at $(2\m,~[4.02:0.02:4.2]\m,~1\m)$, with omnidirectional sensors of flat frequency response. The input SNR between desired and noise signals is $30\dB$, while the input SNR between desired and interference signals (or input SIR) varies per simulation. Filters are calculated every 25 windows, considering the previous 25 windows to calculate correlation matrices.

We compare filters obtained through the STFT and SSBT transforms. N-SSBT uses \cref{eq:sec3:solution_mvdr_beamformer} to (naively) calculate the SSBT beamformer, and T-SSBT will denote the beamformer obtained via the true-distortionless MVDR from \cref{sec:true_mvdr_ssbt}. Performance analysis is conducted via the STFT domain, with the SSBT beamformers being converted into it. In line plots, STFT is presented in red, N-SSBT in green, and T-SSBT in blue.

\subsection{Simulations with \emph{iSIR = 5dB}}

In this scenario, we assume that the input SIR is $5\dB$, and we use analysis windows with: 32 samples in \cref{fig:lineplot_dsrf_32_p5,fig:lineplot_gain_32_p5}; or 64 samples in \cref{fig:lineplot_dsrf_64_p5,fig:lineplot_gain_64_p5}. \cref{fig:lineplot_gain_32_p5,fig:lineplot_gain_64_p5} show the window-wise averaged gain in SNR, and \cref{fig:lineplot_dsrf_32_p5,fig:lineplot_dsrf_64_p5} the window-averaged DSRF, for all presented methods.

While in \cref{fig:lineplot_gain_32_p5} all three beamformers had a similar performance in SNR gain, with no clear advantage of one over another on the overall spectrum, in \cref{fig:lineplot_gain_64_p5} we see that the N-SSBT beamformer had a much worse performance the for higher frequencies, while both the STFT and T-SSBT beamformers' had a similar performance over all frequencies. Also, in both \cref{fig:lineplot_dsrf_32_p5,fig:lineplot_dsrf_64_p5} show that both the T-SSBT and the STFT beamformers ensured a distortionless response, a feature that wasn't achieved by the N-SSBT beamformer. This was expected, since the T-SSBT was appropriately designed to achieve this quality, while the N-SSBT wasn't.

\subsection{Average results per iSIR}

Here, we now take the frequency-average metrics for the beamformers, allowing us to compare them for different values of input SIR, for both $K = 32$ and $K = 64$.

From \cref{fig:lineplot_dsrf_32,fig:lineplot_dsrf_64}, as expected we see that the STFT and T-SSBT beamformers didn't cause distortion on the desired signal, while the N-SSBT did, due to its nature. Im terms of SNR gain, the N-SSBT beamformer had a better performance overall with $K = 32$, while the opposite was true for $K = 64$. Also, in general the T-SSBT beamformer outperformed the STFT beamformer, being at most marginally worse in the case of $K = 32$ and higher input SIRs.

\subsection{Overall result}

In all situations evaluated, the proposed true-MVDR SSBT beamformer had a better (at most equal) performance in terms of SNR gain, compared to the STFT beamformer, both also achieving the appropriate DSRF necessary for the desired distortionless behavior of the MVDR filter, for both number of samples per windows $K$ tested. Meanwhile, the naive SSBT filter had a better overall performance for $K = 32$ for the gain in SNR, and a worse overall performance for $K = 64$, while also incurring some distortion on the desired signal, seen via the DSRF.
