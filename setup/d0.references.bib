Although it has been shown that these signals can be generated using a number of uncorrelated noise sources that are uniformly spaced on a sphere or cylinder, this method is seldom used in practice. In this paper algorithms that generate sensor signals of an arbitrary one- and three-dimensional array that result from a spherically or cylindrically isotropic noise field are developed. Furthermore, the influence of the number of noise sources on the accuracy of the generated sensor signals is investigated.},

	abstract = {We analyze the principles underlying minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming in order to integrate it into a pixel-based algorithm. There is a challenge posed by the low echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) when calculating beamformer contributions at pixels far away from the beam centreline. Together with the well-known scarcity of samples for covariance matrix estimation, this reduces the beamformer performance and degrades the image quality. To address this challenge, we implement the MVDR algorithm in two different ways. First, we develop the conventional minimum variance pixel-based (MVPB) beamformer that performs the MVDR after the pixelbased superposition step. This involves a combination of methods in the literature, extended over multiple transmits to increase the eSNR. Then we propose the coherent MVPB beamformer, where the MVDR is applied to data within individual transmits. Based on pressure field analysis, we develop new algorithms to improve the data alignment and matrix estimation, and hence overcome the low-eSNR issue. The methods are demonstrated on data acquired with an ultrasound open platform. The results show the coherent MVPB beamformer substantially outperforms the conventional MVPB in a series of experiments, including phantom and in vivo studies. Compared to the unified pixelbased beamformer, the newest delay-and-sum algorithm in [1], the coherent MVPB performs well on regions that conform to the diffuse scattering assumptions on which the minimum variance principles are based. It produces less good results for parts of the image that are dominated by specular reflections.},

	abstract = {This paper studies signal models for microphone array beamforming in the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) domain with long acoustic impulse responses. The major contributions are as follows. First, the signal modeling problem is investigated in the STFT domain and a general decomposition is proposed for the convolved source signal. Second, new insights into the array manifold are presented: the STFT of the windowed acoustic impulse response from the source to the sensors. Third, the structure of the reference signal is analyzed: it can be viewed as the output of a beamformer without considering the noise in the observation signal. Fourth, based on the new perspectives and decomposition, a signal model is derived based on the use of the superdirective beamformer. Finally, three performance measures are defined, based on which three optimal/suboptimal signal models are derived and their performance is assessed under different acoustic environments and analysis window lengths. The performance of the well-known minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer is evaluated, which justifies the properties of the developed signal models.

The proposed method is based on the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation, which enables to represent a linear convolution in the time domain as a linear convolution in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Unlike the restrictive and commonly used multiplicative transfer function (MTF) approximation, which becomes more accurate when the length of a time frame increases relative to the length of the impulse response, the CTF approximation enables representation of long impulse responses using short time frames. We develop an unbiased RTF estimator that exploits the nonstationarity and presence probability of the speech signal and derive an analytic expression for the estimator variance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is advantageous compared to common RTF identification methods in various acoustic environments, especially when identifying long RTFs typical to real rooms.},

	abstract = {Interest in parameterized time-frequency analysis for non-stationary signal processing is increasing steadily. An important advantage of such analysis is to provide highly concentrated time-frequency representation with signal-dependent resolution. In this paper, a general scheme, named as general parameterized time-frequency transform (GPTF transform), is proposed for carrying out parameterized time-frequency analysis. The GPTF transform is defined by applying generalized kernel based rotation operator and shift operator. It provides the availability of a single generalized time-frequency transform for applications on signals of different natures. Furthermore, by replacing kernel function, it facilitates the implementation of various parameterized time {\textendash}frequency transforms from the same standpoint. The desirable properties and the dual definition in the frequency domain of GPTF transform are also described in this paper. One of the advantages of the GPTF transform is that the generalized kernel can be customized to characterize the time {\textendash} frequency signature of non-stationary signal. As different kernel formulation has bias toward the signal to be analyzed, a proper kernel is vital to the GPTF. Thus, several potential kernels are provided and discussed in this paper to develop the desired parameterized time {\textendash} frequency transforms. In real applications, it is desired to identify proper kernel with respect to the considered signal. This motivates us to propose an effective method to identify the kernel for the GPTF.},

Compared with the conventional Fourier-transform-based beamforming method, the proposed wavelet-based approach shows significant improvement in the real-time imaging quality and background noise suppression, which is illustrated by representative numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations. The proposed wavelet-based beamforming approach is particularly useful for the acoustic imaging in the time{\textendash}frequency domain for moving sources of a high-subsonic speed and will find applications, such as audio guidance and low-noise airplane design, in robotics and aerospace industry.},

In order to obtain clinically interpretable results, frequency band activities of , {\^A}, and {\"y} signals were mapped onto frequency{\textendash}time axes using the STFT, and 3D WT representations were obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT).

The worst-case optimization method was applied to the binaural minimum-variance distortionless-response (BMVDR) beamformer, for providing robustness against parameter estimation inaccuracies. This property is essential in real-world applications, since it is well known that steering-vector and noise-correlation estimation errors may significantly degrade the BMVDR performance. It is shown that its control parameters can be designed as a function of the noisy-speech interaural-level-difference estimate. Simulation experiments for synthetic and real-world noise, as well as for a range of signal to interference ratios (SIR) were performed. For a particular set of fixed control parameters, it is shown that the mean performance of the conventional BMVDR may be improved by 0.76 wideband perceptual evaluation of speech quality (WPESQ). The proposed method is especially effective for input SIRs higher than 10 dB, which is a crucial range for hearing aid users.},

Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming is an important beamforming method that performs quite well for speech recognition purposes especially if the steering vector is known. However, steering the beamformer to focus on speech in unknown acoustic conditions remains a challenging problem. In this study, we use singlechannel speech enhancement deep networks to form masks that can be used for noise spatial covariance estimation, which steers the MVDR beamforming toward the speech. We analyze how mask prediction affects performance and also discuss various ways to use masks to obtain the speech and noise spatial covariance estimates in a reliable way. We show that using a single mask across microphones for covariance prediction with minima-limited postmasking yields the best result in terms of signal-level quality measures and speech recognition word error rates in a mismatched training condition.},

However, blind estimation of the ATFs remains a difficult task. In this paper the noise reduction of the LCMV beamformer is analyzed and compared with the noise reduction of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. In addition, it is shown that the constraint of the LCMV can be modified such that we only require relative transfer functions rather than ATFs to achieve perfect cancellation of coherent interferences. Finally, we evaluate the noise reduction performance achieved by the LCMV and MVDR beamformers for two coherent sources: one desired and one undesired.},

We derive analytical relations between the number of crossband filters, which are useful for system identification in the STFT domain, and the power and length of the input signal. We show that increasing the number of crossband filters not necessarily implies a lower steady-state mean-square error (mse) in subbands. The number of useful crossband filters depends on the power ratio between the input signal and the additive noise signal. Furthermore, it depends on the effective length of input signal employed for system identification, which is restricted to enable tracking capability of the algorithm during time variations in the system. As the power of input signal increases or as the time variations in the system become slower, a larger number of crossband filters may be utilized. The proposed subband approach is compared to the conventional fullband approach and to the commonly used subband approach that relies on multiplicative transfer function (MTF) approximation. The comparison is carried out in terms of mse performance and computational complexity. Experimental results verify the theoretical derivations and demonstrate the relations between the number of useful crossband filters and the power and length of the input signal.},

Microphone arrays can be employed to enhance the performance of such systems, though they assume a static environment when transitioning to double-talk, and rely on double-talk detection. This work introduces a multichannel echo canceller implemented by a microphone array beamformer that can adapt to a changing environment where the locations of both the farend and near-end sources change during double-talk, with no double-talk detector. This is done by utilizing multiple recent frames in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. We show how can the acoustic paths be accurately estimated given the recent time frames of the far-end and microphone signals. Also, our beamformer aims to reduce background noise. Simulations are conducted in a reverberant room with nonlinear loudspeaker distortion and realistic low signal-to-echo ratio (SER) resembling a speakerphone.

In addition, they are crucial preprocessing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multichannel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These communities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing a large number of established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: 1) the acoustic impulse response model, 2) the spatial filter design criterion, 3) the parameter estimation algorithm, and 4) optional postfiltering. We conclude this overview paper by providing a list of software and data resources and by discussing perspectives and future trends in the field.},

Specifically, two well-known variants, namely the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers, are considered. In our scenario, which is typical to many modern communications systems, waves emitted by multiple point sources are received by an antenna array. An analytical expression for the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) improvement obtained by both beamformers under steering errors is derived. These expression are experimentally evaluated and compared with the robust Capon beamformer (RCB), a robust variant of the MPDR beamformer. We show that the MVDR beamformer, which uses the noise correlation matrix in its minimization criterion, is more robust to steering errors than its counterparts, that use the received signal correlation matrix. Furthermore, even if the noise correlation matrix is erroneously estimated due to steering errors in the interference direction, the MVDR advantage is still maintained for reasonable range of steering errors. These conclusions conform with Cox [1] findings. Only line of sight propagation regime is considered in the current contribution. Ongoing research extends this work to fading channels.},

Classical subband adaptive filters employ DFT-based analysis and synthesis filter banks which results in subband signals that are complex-valued. The authors modify the structure of subband adaptive filters by using single-sideband (SSB) modulated analysis and synthesis filter banks, which result in subband signals that are realvalued.

This paper provides subband WaveNet based on multirate signal processing for high-speed and high-quality synthesis with raw audio generative models. In the training stage, speech waveforms are decomposed and decimated into subband short waveforms with a low sampling rate, and each subband WaveNet network is trained using each subband stream. In the synthesis stage, each generated signal is upsampled and integrated into a fullband speech signal. The results of objective and subjective experiments for unconditional WaveNet with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz indicate that the proposed subband WaveNet with a square-root Hann window-based overlapped 9-channel single-sideband filterbank can realize about four times the synthesis speed and improve the synthesized speech quality more than the conventional fullband WaveNet.},

However, the HF-SSB received speech is corrupted by both high-power noise and severe channel fading, and the typical speech enhancement methods only focus on the suppression of additive noise. In this letter, a two-stage hybrid approach is proposed to enhance the speech quality of the HF-SSB radio. In the anti-fading stage, we adopt the anti-fading convolution neural network (AF-CNN) to eliminate the effects of channel fading. In the noise suppression stage, noise suppression CNN (NS-CNN) subnet and unsupervised denoising block are used parallelly to further improve the performance and the generalization ability. In addition, we present the optimal topological relations of noise suppression and anti-fading modules by comparison and analysis. Experimental results show that applying the AF-CNN subnet before noise suppression can effectively help recover the weak speech components. Moreover, in terms of objective intelligibility and quality scores, the overall performance of the proposed method outperforms the typical methods that only consider noise suppression.},

	abstract = {Communication system mismatch represents a major influence in the losses of both speech quality and speaker recognition system performance. Although microphone and handset differences have been considered for speaker recognition (e.g., NIST SRE), nonlinear communication system differences, such as modulation/demodulation (Mod/DeMod) carrier mismatch, have yet to be explored. While such mismatch was common in traditional analog communications, today, with the diversity and blending of communication technologies, it is reconsidered as a major distortion. This paper is focused on estimating and correcting the frequency-shift distortion resulting from Mod/DeMod carrier frequency mismatch in high-frequency single sideband (HF-SSB) speech. To overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions, a two-step algorithm is proposed to improve estimation performance. In the first step, the offset of speech is scaled to a small frequency interval, which eliminates or reduces the nonuniqueness issue due to the periodicity within the spectrum; the second step performs fine tuning within the estimated predetermined uniqueness interval (UI). For the first time, a statistical framework is developed for UI detection, where an innovative acoustic feature is proposed to represent alternative frequency shifts. Additionally, in the estimation process, statistical techniques such as GMM-SVM, i-Vector, and deep neural networks are applied in the first step to improve the estimation accuracy. An evaluation using DARPA RATS HF-SSB data shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement in the estimation performance (up to +35.6\% improvement in accuracy), speech quality measurement (up to +27.3\% relative improvement in the PESQ score), and speaker verification (up to +59.9\% relative improvement in equal error rate).},

First, an analytical relation between the input and the output signals is derived in the SSB domain. Then, a system identification routine is formulated for a band-to-band approximation of that relation. Second, the dereverberation problem is addressed, using a statistical model for the acoustic impulse response (AIR) function. Exact and approximate representations of the AIR and the reverberant signal are derived directly in the SSB domain. The performance of the dereverberation algorithm is evaluated as a function of the representation complexity.

The source of distortion may be linear, such as local speech or background noise, or nonlinear due to speech coding used in the telecommunication networks. Detailed derivation of the error recovery nonlinearity (ERN), which {\textquotedblleft}enhances{\textquotedblright} the filter estimation error prior to the adaptation in order to assist the linear adaptation process, will be provided. Connections to other existing AEC and signal enhancement techniques will be revealed. In particular, the error enhancement technique is well-founded in the informationtheoretic sense and has strong ties to independent component analysis (ICA), which is the basis for blind source separation (BSS) that permits unsupervised adaptation in the presence of multiple interfering signals. The single-channel AEC problem can be viewed as a special case of semi-blind source separation (SBSS) where one of the source signals is partially known, i.e., the far-end microphone signal that generates the near-end acoustic echo. The system approach to robust AEC will be motivated, where a proper integration of the LMS algorithm with the ERN into the AEC {\textquotedblleft}system{\textquotedblright} allows for continuous and stable adaptation even during double talk without precise estimation of the signal statistics. The error enhancement paradigm encompasses many traditional signal enhancement techniques and opens up an entirely new avenue for solving the AEC problem in a real-world setting.},

	abstract = {Information transmission in biological signaling circuits has often been described using the metaphor of a noise filter. Cellular systems need accurate real-time data about their environmental conditions, but the biochemical reaction networks that propagate, amplify, and process signals work with noisy representations of that data. Biology must implement strategies that not only filter the noise but also predict the current state of the environment based on information delayed due to the finite speed of chemical signaling. The idea of a biochemical noise filter is actually more than just a metaphor: we describe recent work that has made an explicit mathematical connection between signaling fidelity in cellular circuits and the classic theories of optimal noise filtering and prediction that began with Wiener, Kolmogorov, Shannon, and Bode. This theoretical framework provides a versatile tool, allowing us to derive analytical bounds on the maximum mutual information between the environmental signal and the real-time estimate constructed by the system. It helps us understand how the structure of a biological network, and the response times of its components, influences the accuracy of that estimate. The theory also provides insights into how evolution may have tuned enzyme kinetic parameters and populations to optimize information transfer.},

	abstract = {{\DH}Capturing live motion has gained considerable attention in computer animation as an important motion generation technique. Canned motion data are comprised of both position and orientation components. Although a great number of signal processing methods are available for manipulating position data, the majority of these methods cannot be generalized easily to orientation data due to the inherent nonlinearity of the orientation space. In this paper, we present a new scheme that enables us to apply a filter mask (or a convolution filter) to orientation data. The key idea is to transform the orientation data into their analogues in a vector space, to apply a filter mask on them, and then to transform the results back to the orientation space. This scheme gives timedomain filters for orientation data that are computationally efficient and satisfy such important properties as coordinate-invariance, time-invariance, and symmetry. Experimental results indicate that our scheme is useful for various purposes including smoothing and sharpening.},

The Edge filter group highlights edges surrounding both shallow and deeper magnetic sources. The results are used to infer the location of the boundaries of magnetised lithologies. The Block filter group has the effect of transforming the data into {\textquotedblleft}zones{\textquotedblright} which, similar to image classification systems, segregate anomalous zones into apparent lithological categories. Both filter groups change the textural character of a dataset and thereby facilitate interpretation of geological structures.},

	title = {Functional {Beamforming}},
	abstract = {A new beamforming algorithm is introduced. It is called Functional Beamforming because it uses the mathematics of functions of matrices. The algorithm depends on an exponent parameter. The array Cross Spectral Matrix is raised to the power of the reciprocal of this exponent in the functional sense. Conventional Frequency Domain Beamforming is applied using the modified CSM, and the values of the resulting beamform map are raised to power of the non-reciprocal exponent. For large values of the exponent, array sidelobes are essentially eliminated. This increases flexibility in array design and dramatically increases the dynamic range of the system so that new sources may be discovered. Theory is given that proves that the method will not eliminate or even reduce true sources if the steering vector is accurate. This depends on the quality the array calibration, but the requirements are not extraordinary. Examples are given comparing the method with Robust Adaptive Beamforming, CLEAN-SC, Orthogonal Beamforming, and to some degree, Linear Programming. A previously unknown noise source of Boeing 747 desk models is shown.},

	abstract = {The minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer is very sensitive to errors, such as the the snite snapshots and the steering vector errors. A small mismatch can lead to serious degradation to its performance, especially at high signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). In this paper, a new robust MVDR beamformer is proposed. Our analysis starts from the physical meaning of the MVDR weight vector formula. Based on this analysis, DOA matrix is constructed in the single uniform linear array. Through the decomposition of this DOA matrix, we could obtain the actual signal modes contained in the covariance matrix of the snapshots. Then the weight vector could be modised to solve the robustness problem of MVDR beamforming. The computer simulation shows the effectiveness of this method.},
