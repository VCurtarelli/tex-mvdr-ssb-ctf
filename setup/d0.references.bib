	abstract = {This paper presents a robust beamformer for stereo noise reduction in hearing aid applications. The worst-case optimization method was applied to the binaural minimum-variance distortionless-response (BMVDR) beamformer, for providing robustness against parameter estimation inaccuracies. This property is essential in real-world applications, since it is well known that steering-vector and noise-correlation estimation errors may significantly degrade the BMVDR performance. It is shown that its control parameters can be designed as a function of the noisy-speech interaural-level-difference estimate. Simulation experiments for synthetic and real-world noise, as well as for a range of signal to interference ratios (SIR) were performed. For a particular set of fixed control parameters, it is shown that the mean performance of the conventional BMVDR may be improved by 0.76 wideband perceptual evaluation of speech quality (WPESQ). The proposed method is especially effective for input SIRs higher than 10 dB, which is a crucial range for hearing aid users.},

	abstract = {This paper studies signal models for microphone array beamforming in the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) domain with long acoustic impulse responses. The major contributions are as follows. First, the signal modeling problem is investigated in the STFT domain and a general decomposition is proposed for the convolved source signal. Second, new insights into the array manifold are presented: the STFT of the windowed acoustic impulse response from the source to the sensors. Third, the structure of the reference signal is analyzed: it can be viewed as the output of a beamformer without considering the noise in the observation signal. Fourth, based on the new perspectives and decomposition, a signal model is derived based on the use of the superdirective beamformer. Finally, three performance measures are defined, based on which three optimal/suboptimal signal models are derived and their performance is assessed under different acoustic environments and analysis window lengths. The performance of the well-known minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer is evaluated, which justifies the properties of the developed signal models.

The proposed method is based on the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation, which enables to represent a linear convolution in the time domain as a linear convolution in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Unlike the restrictive and commonly used multiplicative transfer function (MTF) approximation, which becomes more accurate when the length of a time frame increases relative to the length of the impulse response, the CTF approximation enables representation of long impulse responses using short time frames. We develop an unbiased RTF estimator that exploits the nonstationarity and presence probability of the speech signal and derive an analytic expression for the estimator variance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is advantageous compared to common RTF identification methods in various acoustic environments, especially when identifying long RTFs typical to real rooms.},

Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming is an important beamforming method that performs quite well for speech recognition purposes especially if the steering vector is known. However, steering the beamformer to focus on speech in unknown acoustic conditions remains a challenging problem. In this study, we use singlechannel speech enhancement deep networks to form masks that can be used for noise spatial covariance estimation, which steers the MVDR beamforming toward the speech. We analyze how mask prediction affects performance and also discuss various ways to use masks to obtain the speech and noise spatial covariance estimates in a reliable way. We show that using a single mask across microphones for covariance prediction with minima-limited postmasking yields the best result in terms of signal-level quality measures and speech recognition word error rates in a mismatched training condition.},

	abstract = {We analyze the principles underlying minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming in order to integrate it into a pixel-based algorithm. There is a challenge posed by the low echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) when calculating beamformer contributions at pixels far away from the beam centreline. Together with the well-known scarcity of samples for covariance matrix estimation, this reduces the beamformer performance and degrades the image quality. To address this challenge, we implement the MVDR algorithm in two different ways. First, we develop the conventional minimum variance pixel-based (MVPB) beamformer that performs the MVDR after the pixelbased superposition step. This involves a combination of methods in the literature, extended over multiple transmits to increase the eSNR. Then we propose the coherent MVPB beamformer, where the MVDR is applied to data within individual transmits. Based on pressure field analysis, we develop new algorithms to improve the data alignment and matrix estimation, and hence overcome the low-eSNR issue. The methods are demonstrated on data acquired with an ultrasound open platform. The results show the coherent MVPB beamformer substantially outperforms the conventional MVPB in a series of experiments, including phantom and in vivo studies. Compared to the unified pixelbased beamformer, the newest delay-and-sum algorithm in [1], the coherent MVPB performs well on regions that conform to the diffuse scattering assumptions on which the minimum variance principles are based. It produces less good results for parts of the image that are dominated by specular reflections.},

For this purpose, we developed a program using Labview software. Labview is an application development environment that uses a graphical language G, usable with an online applicable National Instruments data acquisition card. In order to obtain clinically interpretable results, frequency band activities of , {\^A}, and {\"y} signals were mapped onto frequency{\textendash}time axes using the STFT, and 3D WT representations were obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Both results were compared, and it was determined that the STFT was more applicable for real-time processing of EEG signals, due to its short process time. However, the CWT still had good resolution and performance high enough for use in clinical and research settings.},

In this paper the noise reduction of the LCMV beamformer is analyzed and compared with the noise reduction of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. In addition, it is shown that the constraint of the LCMV can be modified such that we only require relative transfer functions rather than ATFs to achieve perfect cancellation of coherent interferences.
