A set of linear equality constraints on the weights maintains a chosen frequency characteristic for the array in the direction of interest. The array problem would be a classical constrained least-meansquares problem except that the signal and noise statistics are assumed unknown a priori.

Though the environment settings may change in time, microphone locations are typically preserved. Thus, the selected locations are of signiﬁcant importance. Moreover, if the source of interest emits a broadband signal from a location that varies in time, ﬁnding the optimal geometry becomes a challenging task. This paper introduces an efﬁcient algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal placements of microphones in a nonuniform linear array for broadband high directivity beamforming. The proposed method maintains high white noise gain (WNG) for sufﬁcient robustness and considers several look directions in a region-of-interest (ROI) for a moving source.

We propose two techniques for designing planar beamformers that can maintain different beamwidths in the XZ and YZ planes based on constant-beamwidth linear arrays. In the ﬁrst technique, we utilize Kronecker product beamforming to ﬁnd the weights, thus eliminating matrix inversion. The second technique provides a closed-form solution that allows for a tradeoff between white noise gain and directivity factor. The second technique is applicable even when only a subset of the sensors is used. Since our techniques are based on linear arrays, we also consider symmetric linear arrays. We present a method that determines where sensors should be placed to maximize the directivity and increase the frequency range over which the beamwidth remains constant, with a minimal number of sensors. Simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed design methods compared to the stateof-the-art. Speciﬁcally, our method yields a 1000-fold faster runtime than the competing method, while improving the wideband directivity factor by over 8 dB without compromising the wideband white noise gain in the simulated scenario.},

We decompose a global rectangular beamformer into a KP of two subbeamformers: a constant-beamwidth beamformer along the y-axis and a super-directive (SD) beamformer along the x-axis. We propose two design methods to derive global rectangular beamformers whose either white noise gain (WNG) or directivity factor (DF) may be set by design. We show that the proposed rectangular beamformers exhibit improved directivity with respect to the linear CB beamformer, particularly in high frequencies, and improved robustness to spatially white noise with respect to the linear SD beamformer. Finally, the proposed rectangular beamformers exhibit the constant-beamwidth property, with an inherent tradeoff between the constant-beamwidth threshold frequency and the array directivity, which is tuned by the number of microphones along each axis.},

In this paper the noise reduction of the LCMV beamformer is analyzed and compared with the noise reduction of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. In addition, it is shown that the constraint of the LCMV can be modiﬁed such that we only require relative transfer functions rather than ATFs to achieve perfect cancellation of coherent interferences. Finally, we evaluate the noise reduction performance achieved by the LCMV and MVDR beamformers for two coherent sources: one desired and one undesired.},

In comparison with a recently developed method that restricts the number of microphones of the given physical array to a multiplication of two integers, each corresponding to the number of sensors of one virtual array, the approach in this work decomposes the physical array in such a way that the sensors in the two virtual arrays may share positions and the number of microphones of the physical array can be any positive integer.

However, precise antenna array calibration remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a new method for calibrating a GNSS antenna array using live signals and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Moreover, a second method that employs the calibration results for the estimation of steering vectors is also proposed. These two methods are applied to the receiver in two modes, namely calibration and operation. In the calibration mode, a two-stage optimization for precise calibration is used; in the first stage, constant uncertainties are estimated while in the second stage, the dependency of each antenna element gain and phase patterns to the received signal direction of arrival (DOA) is considered for refined calibration. In the operation mode, a low-complexity iterative and fast-converging method is applied to estimate the satellite signal steering vectors using the calibration results. This makes the technique suitable for real-time applications employing a precisely calibrated antenna array. The proposed calibration method is applied to GPS signals to verify its applicability and assess its performance. Furthermore, the data set is used to evaluate the proposed iterative method in the receiver operation mode for two different applications, namely attitude determination and SNR enhancement.},

However, most efforts in the literature so far have been devoted to linear, circular, and spherical arrays. In this paper, we consider rectangular shapes of planar microphone arrays. Instead of adopting the traditional differential beamforming methods developed in the literature, we present a differential beamforming method based on the so-called Kronecker product. We ﬁrst decompose the entire rectangular array into two virtual rectangular sub-arrays so that the steering vector of the entire array is the Kronecker product of the steering vectors of the two smaller virtual rectangular sub-arrays. We use the ﬁrst virtual rectangular array, which is much smaller in size than the entire array but well satisﬁes the basic requirements for differential beamforming, to design a steerable differential beamformer. For the second virtual rectangular array, we can design either the delay-and-sum (DS) beamformer, which helps to improve the robustness of the global differential beamformer, or an adaptive beamformer, which makes the global differential beamformer adaptive. This method has many interesting properties, particularly the designed beamformer is fully steerable, and its robustness and the array gain can be easily controlled.},

Constant beamwidth beamformers enable a ﬁxed beamwidth over a wide range of frequencies. Most of the existing approaches to design constant beamwidth beamformers are based on optimization algorithms with high computational complexity and are often sensitive to microphone mismatches. Other existing methods are based on adjusting the number of sensors according to the frequency, which simplify the design, but cannot control the sidelobe level. Here, we propose a window-based technique to attain the beamwidth constancy, in which different shapes of standard window functions are applied for different frequency bins as the real weighting coefﬁcients of microphones. Thereby, not only do we keep the beamwidth constant, but we also control the sidelobe level. Simulation results show the advantages of our method compared with existing methods, including lower sidelobe level, higher directivity factor, and higher white noise gain.},

We decompose the problem by designing a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer and a constant-beamwidth beamformer based on the window technique. Subsequently, we utilize Kronecker product beamforming to merge the two elementary beamformers. While a competing method restricts the beamwidth depending on the interelement spacing and number of sensors in the array, the proposed method enables a flexible design of an arbitrary beamwidth. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach compared to the competing method. Specifically, the proposed beamformer achieves the desired beamwidth and directional constraints with a significantly higher directivity factor and lower sidelobe levels.},

For the case with a single source, a simple and robust least-squares algorithm for joint 2-D DOA estimation and phase calibration is presented. When performing phase autocalibration with a URA, the phase and DOA parameters cannot be identiﬁed together without ambiguity. This problem is discussed and a suitable remedy is suggested.

MRLAs have attractive features for linear sparse arrays, even if the built-in surface is deformed, it works without problems. To our knowledge, MRLAs have not been applied to smart devices so far. In this work, a 7-element ULAs and 4-element MRLAs (same aperture) were used for the simulation. The Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW) is 0.666 and the Null-to-Null Beamwidth (𝐵𝑊𝑁𝑁) is 1.385 in ψ-space.

It is shown that a number of appropriately trained neural networks can be successfully used for the high-resolution DOA estimation of narrowband sources in both azimuth and elevation. The training time of each smaller network is significantly reduced as different training sets are used for networks in detection and estimation stage. By avoiding the spectral search, the proposed method is suitable for real-time applications as it provides DOA estimates in a matter of seconds.

Precise PD source location is crucial for undertaking maintenance of mentioned equipment. This paper concerns the issue of partial discharges sources location using phased rectangular arrays technique and high-resolution direction of arrival estimation technology. In addition to the theoretical assumptions of both techniques, the simulation result, in which an Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) was used for registration of the electromagnetic signals generated by defects in power transformer insulation system, were shown. To estimate the Direction of Arrival (DOA) of electromagnetic signals, that propagate from the discharge-generating defect to the transducer array installed on transformer tank, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) algorithm was chosen. The location of defect was determined using two intersecting lines defined by the DOAs from two URAs. With the ability to locate multisource discharges (even at very low signal to noise ratio –SNR), the adopted solution has advantages over conventional techniques.},

	abstract = {Null-steering transmit beamformers aim to maximize the received signal power in the direction of the intended receiver while substantially reducing the power impinging on the unintended receivers located in other directions. The existing null-steering beamformers may not be directly applied in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as they do not conform with the decentralized nature of WSNs and require every node to be aware of the locations of all other nodes in the network. This manuscript presents a novel collaborative null-steering beamformer that can be implemented in uniformly distributed WSNs in which each node is oblivious of other nodes’ locations. The average beampattern expression of the proposed beamformer is derived and it is shown that the beampattern associated with any arbitrary realization of the nodes’ locations converges with probability one to the so-obtained average beampattern as the number of collaborating nodes grows large. Properties of the average beampattern are analytically studied. In particular, it is proven that the average gain of the proposed beamformer is inversely proportional to the number of collaborating nodes in the directions of unintended receivers and further, if a mild condition is satisﬁed, it is approximately equal to that of the collaborative conventional beamformer in the directions with far angular distance from any unintended receiver. It is argued that if virtual unintended receivers are assumed at proper directions, then the proposed collaborative null-steering beamformer can form an average beampattern with sidelobe peaks substantially smaller than those of the average beampattern of the collaborative conventional beamformer. To substantiate this argument, the optimal direction of a virtual unintended receiver is obtained such that its associated collaborative null-steering beamformer forms an average beampattern with minimal largest sidelobe peak. Depending on the number of collaborating nodes, it is further shown that the largest average sidelobe peak of the latter beamformer is up to 6.6 (dB) less than that of the collaborative conventional beamformer.},

	abstract = {The estimation of signal covariance matrices is a crucial part of many signal processing algorithms. In some applications, the structure of the problem suggests that the underlying, true covariance matrix is the Kronecker product of two valid covariance matrices. Examples of such problems are channel modeling for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and signal modeling of EEG data. In applications, it may also be that the Kronecker factors in turn can be assumed to possess additional, linear structure. The maximum-likelihood (ML) method for the associated estimation problem has been proposed previously. It is asymptotically efﬁcient but has the drawback of requiring an iterative search for the maximum of the likelihood function. Two methods that are fast and noniterative are proposed in this paper. Both methods are shown to be asymptotically efﬁcient. The ﬁrst method is a noniterative variant of a well-known alternating maximization technique for the likelihood function. It performs on par with ML in simulations but has the drawback of not allowing for extra structure in addition to the Kronecker structure. The second method is based on covariance matching principles and does not suffer from this drawback. However, while the large sample performance is the same, it performs somewhat worse than the ﬁrst estimator in small samples. In addition, the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the problem is derived in a compact form. The problem of estimating the Kronecker factors and the problem of detecting if the Kronecker structure is a good model for the covariance matrix of a set of samples are related. Therefore, the problem of detecting the dimensions of the Kronecker factors based on the minimum values of the criterion functions corresponding to the two proposed estimation methods is also treated in this work.},

The diversity benefit is exploited by tracking the channel fluctuations of the users and scheduling transmissions to users when their instantaneous channel quality is near the peak. The diversity gain increases with the dynamic range of the fluctuations and is thus limited in environments with little scattering and/or slow fading. In such environments, we propose the use of multiple transmit antennas to induce large and fast channel fluctuations so that multiuser diversity can still be exploited. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic beamforming and we show that true beamforming gains can be achieved when there are sufficient users, even though very limited channel feedback is needed. Furthermore, in a cellular system, the scheme plays an additional role of opportunistic nulling of the interference created on users of adjacent cells. We discuss the design implications of implementing this scheme in a complete wireless system.},

Under the assumption of imperfect angles of departure for the wiretap channels, the hybrid beamformer at the base station and digital beamformers at the satellite are jointly designed to maximize the achievable secrecy-energy efﬁciency, while satisfying signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio constraints of both the earth stations (ESs) and cellular users. Since the formulated optimization problem is nonconvex and mathematically intractable, we propose two robust BF schemes to obtain approximate solutions with low complexity. Speciﬁcally, for the case of a single ES, we integrate the Charnes-Cooper approach with an iterative search algorithm to convert the original nonconvex problem into a solvable one and obtain the BF weight vectors. In the case of multiple ESs, by exploiting the sequential convex approximation method, we convert the original problem into a linear one with multiple matrix inequalities and second-order cone constraints, for which we obtain a solution with satisfactory performance. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed robust BF design schemes are validated via simulations using realistic satellite and terrestrial downlink channel models.},

We propose a fast-convergence trilinear decomposition approach, which uses propagator method (PM) as the initialization of the angle estimation to speed the convergence of trilinear decomposition. The received signal of each subarray can be ﬁtted into a trilinear model or parallel factor (PARAFAC) model so that the trilinear alternating least square algorithm can be used to estimate the angle information. Meanwhile, the necessary initialization of DOA estimates can be achieved via PM, which endows the proposed approach a fast convergence and subsequently results in a low complexity. Speciﬁcally, we eliminate the ambiguous estimates by utilizing the coprime property and the true DOA estimates can be achieved by selecting the nearest ones of all DOA estimates. The proposed approach can obtain the same estimation performance as the conventional PARAFAC algorithm, but with a low computational cost. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

By considering total power constraint (TPC) or per-antenna power constraint (PPC) at the UAV, we ﬁrst formulate an optimization problem to maximize the energy efﬁciency of the SATN, which is deﬁned as ratio of the ergodic capacity to the total power consumption for communication at UAV. Then, by jointly exploiting array signal processing with the Dinkelbach’s method, two new beamforming (BF) schemes, namely, TPC-BF and PPC-BF are proposed to solve the non-convex energy efﬁciency maximization problem. The main advantage of our method is that only angular information-based channel state information is used to obtain BF weight vectors so that a low implementation complexity is achieved. Furthermore, by assuming that the satellite-UAV link undergoes correlated Shadowed-Rician fading while the UAV-terminal link experiences correlated Rician fading, closed-form expressions for the statistics of the equivalent output signal-to-noise ratio are derived and, thus energy efﬁciency for the considered SATN with BF schemes is analytically presented. Finally, simulation results corroborate the derived expressions and conﬁrm the effectiveness of the proposed BF schemes.},

	abstract = {The problem of source separation using an array of microphones in reverberant and noisy conditions is addressed. We consider applying the well-known linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer (BF) for extracting individual speakers. Constraints are deﬁned using relative transfer functions (RTFs) for the sources, which are ratios of acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between any microphone and a reference microphone. The latter are usually estimated by methods that rely on single-talk time segments where only a single source is active and on reliable knowledge of the source activity. Two novel algorithms for estimation of RTFs using the “Triple N” ICA for convolutive mixtures (TRINICON) framework are proposed, not resorting to the usually unavailable source activity pattern. The ﬁrst algorithm estimates the RTFs of the sources by applying multiple two-channel geometrically constrained (GC) TRINICON units, where approximate direction of arrival information for the sources is utilized for ensuring convergence to the desired solution. The GC-TRINICON is applied to all microphone pairs using a common reference microphone. In the second algorithm, we propose to estimate RTFs iteratively using GC-TRINICON, where instead of using a ﬁxed reference microphone as before, we suggest to use the output signals of LCMV-BFs from the previous iteration as spatially processed references with improved signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. For both algorithms, a simple detection of noise-only time segments is required for estimating the covariance matrix of noise and interference. We conduct an experimental study in which the performance of the proposed methods is conﬁrmed and compared to corresponding supervised methods.},

In the proposed approach, instead of directly designing the differential beamformer, we break it down following the decomposition of the steering vector, and show how to derive differential beamformers using the Kronecker product formulation.

In addition, the tradeoff between dereverberation and noise reduction is analyzed. This analysis is done for a mixture of coherent and non-coherent noise fields and entirely non-coherent noise fields. It is shown that maximum noise reduction is achieved when the MVDR beamformer is used for noise reduction only. The amount of noise reduction that is sacrificed when complete dereverberation is required depends on the directto- reverberation ratio of the acoustic impulse response between the source and the reference microphone.

Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming is an important beamforming method that performs quite well for speech recognition purposes especially if the steering vector is known. However, steering the beamformer to focus on speech in unknown acoustic conditions remains a challenging problem. In this study, we use singlechannel speech enhancement deep networks to form masks that can be used for noise spatial covariance estimation, which steers the MVDR beamforming toward the speech. We analyze how mask prediction aﬀects performance and also discuss various ways to use masks to obtain the speech and noise spatial covariance estimates in a reliable way. We show that using a single mask across microphones for covariance prediction with minima-limited postmasking yields the best result in terms of signal-level quality measures and speech recognition word error rates in a mismatched training condition.},

	abstract = {In real-world environments, the signals captured by a set of microphones in a speech communication system are mixtures of the desired signal, interference, and ambient noise. A promising solution for proper speech acquisition (with reduced noise and interference) in this context consists in using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer to reject the interference, reduce the overall mixture energy, and preserve the target signal. The minimum variance distortionless response beamformer (MVDR) is also commonly known to reduce the interferenceplus-noise energy without distorting the desired signal. In either case, it is of paramount importance to accurately quantify the achieved noise and interference reduction. Indeed, it is quite reasonable to ask, for instance, about the price that has to be paid in order to achieve total removal of the interference without distorting the target signal when using the LCMV. Besides, it is fundamental to understand the effect of the MVDR on both noise and interference. In this correspondence, we investigate the performance of the MVDR and LCMV beamformers when the interference and ambient noise coexist with the target source. We demonstrate a new relationship between both ﬁlters in which the MVDR is decomposed into the LCMV and a matched ﬁlter (MVDR solution in the absence of interference). Both components are properly weighted to achieve maximum interference-plusnoise reduction. We investigate the performance of the MVDR, LCMV, and matched ﬁlters and elaborate new closed-form expressions for their output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We theoretically demonstrate the tradeoff that has to be made between noise reduction and interference rejection. In fact, the total removal of the interference may severely amplify the residual ambient noise. Conversely, totally focussing on noise reduction leads to increased level of residual interference. The proposed study is ﬁnally supported by several numerical examples.},
